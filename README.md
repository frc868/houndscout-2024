An extra note about this branch:
This is the result of me trying to convert everything from David's Charged Up prototype to Crescendo's gameplay. It's a very rough conversion since I can't actually run Next.js yet and I don't know how we're going to do Stage scoring, so this is by no means working.

First, run the development server:

```bash
