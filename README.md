## An extra note about this branch:

This is the result of me trying to convert everything from David's Charged Up prototype to Crescendo's gameplay. It's a very rough conversion since I can't actually run Next.js yet and I don't know how we're actually going to do Stage scoring, so this is by no means working. Hopefully some of these concepts can be transferred to the finished one though.

Also, I'm thinking that aside from the very rough stage panel I came up with, we could have the human players' actions at the Amp be recorded by the lead scouter. If we actually do that stuff.
